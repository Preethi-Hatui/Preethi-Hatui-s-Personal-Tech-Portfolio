AAT - 1: Case Study on Amazon Transcribe

Introduction

Amazon Transcribe is an AWS cloud service that automatically converts speech into text. It enables users to transcribe both live and pre-recorded audio or video files with high accuracy. The service is widely used for generating subtitles, analyzing call center conversations, and making spoken content searchable.

How Amazon Transcribe Works

Amazon Transcribe works by processing audio or video input and converting it into text output using machine learning. Below is a simplified workflow of how it functions:

Input Source: Audio or video file is provided as input (real-time streaming or pre-recorded file).

Pre-processing: The file is converted into a format suitable for transcription.

Speech Recognition: AWS applies machine learning models to convert speech to text.

Post-processing: Optional features like speaker identification and content removal are applied.

Output Generation: The final text output is available for download and analysis.
