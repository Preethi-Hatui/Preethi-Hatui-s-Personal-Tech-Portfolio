# üìú Modern Portfolio Website ‚ú®

This portfolio showcases my skills through an immersive interactive experience. The highlight is a functional tablet simulator containing my projects. The design uses modern glassmorphism with dynamic animations including floating bubbles, particle effects, and smooth transitions. The fully responsive layout adapts to all devices while maintaining visual appeal. The code demonstrates clean organization with semantic HTML, modular CSS, and efficient JavaScript for animations.
